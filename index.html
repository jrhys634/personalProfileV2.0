<!-- About Me -->
<div class="about" id="iabout">
    <p class="about_text">
        Im a dynamic and driven individual who seamlessly combines the world of code with a kaleidoscope of interests. As an aspiring Software Developer, my fervor for crafting innovative digital solutions is matched only by my zeal for diverse physical pursuits. Beyond the lines of code, i find solace and inspiration in the realm of Martial Arts, where discipline and strategy intertwine, echoing the same principles that drive my software endeavors. My love for high-speed adrenaline is evidenced by my passion for F1 racing, where the pursuit of perfection mirrors my pursuit of elegant code. But my interests don't halt at the finish line; im equally at home discussing the intricacies of football, ice hockey, and snowboarding. Hailing from Greater Manchester, England, and possessing fluency in Spanish, this software enthusiast transcends boundaries—geographical and technological—with a rich tapestry of skills and passions.
